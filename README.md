Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am Dezen. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m interested in learning new knowledge. In fact, there are many programming languages in the world for different purposes, like C and C++ are for software development, and VHDL is for hardware description. 

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently preparing for my final examination.  
 
- âš¡ My favorite hobby: Cooking. I would watch some online videos to learn cooking, but sometimes, when I have followed their cooking instructions and recipes, I cannot cook the food in my expectation. For example, I have watched an online video teaching people how to cook hash browns and it requires me to buy a lot of ingredients for making it, which are expensive. I have tried to do so, but ultimately I cannot make a piece of hash browns which he shows in the video. Sometimes, it is a better way to learn something through exploring the method by ourselves, rather than just merely believing others people's method.
